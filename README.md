# FastAPI Full-Stack Boilerplate

## Features

1. All the goodness of modern, async FastAPI
2. Seamless Jinja2 templating, just like Flask
3. SQLAlchemy ORM and Alembic migrations
4. Flask-Admin plugged right in
5. Pipenv for python dependency management

## Why?

The dependency-injection provided by FastAPI is such a huge improvement over any other python web framework. It's OpenAPI integration is excellent, and it's `asgi`-first, unlike Flask or Django.

But Django is famous for its admin panel, and the ability to rapidly build server side applications. For this, we include Flask-Admin, and centralied Jinja2 templates as a dependency.
